# TubeTrust: The Transparency Prototype

**Group:** Hive  
**Course:** CS412 - User Modeling  

## Overview
This Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrates our thesis: that algorithmic transparency is an ethical imperative for adaptive systems. The prototype mimics a video feed with two modes:
1. **Black Box (Default):** Standard opaque recommendations.
2. **Glass Box (Toggle On):** Reveals the "Why?" behind every video, including Match Scores and Diversity warnings.
